"UNIT 9.37 Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) Kindling Model of Epilepsy","This unit describes a protocol to perform chemical kindling in mice. Kindling is a chronic animal model of epilepsy that has been extensively studied to understand the process of epileptogenesis and discover novel anti‐epileptic compounds. Kindling is a phenomenon where a sub‐convulsive stimulus (either chemical or electrical), if applied repetitively and intermittently, will ultimately lead to the generation of full‐blown convulsions. Kindling can be induced either by (1) electrical stimulation of different brain regions (electrical kindling) or (2) using various chemical agents (chemical kindling). This unit discusses in detail the methodology to execute pentylenetetrazol (PTZ; a GABAA receptor antagonist)–induced chemical kindling in mice. PTZ is administered chronically at a sub‐convulsive dose for a number of days. Seizure score is calculated after each PTZ injection. The effect of test/reference compounds can be tested by administering them either prior to the initiation of kindling (pre‐kindling phase) or after animals are fully kindled (post‐kindling phase).

"Interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community","Approximately 30% of people over 65 years of age living in the community fall each year. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009. To assess the effects of interventions designed to reduce the incidence of falls in older people living in the community. We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (February 2012), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1946 to March 2012), EMBASE (1947 to March 2012), CINAHL (1982 to February 2012), and online trial registers. Randomised trials of interventions to reduce falls in community-dwelling older people. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used a rate ratio (RaR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare the rate of falls (e.g. falls per person year) between intervention and control groups. For risk of falling, we used a risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI based on the number of people falling (fallers) in each group. We pooled data where appropriate. We included 159 trials with 79,193 participants. Most trials compared a fall prevention intervention with no intervention or an intervention not expected to reduce falls. The most common interventions tested were exercise as a single intervention (59 trials) and multifactorial programmes (40 trials). Sixty-two per cent (99/159) of trials were at low risk of bias for sequence generation, 60% for attrition bias for falls (66/110), 73% for attrition bias for fallers (96/131), and only 38% (60/159) for allocation concealment. Multiple-component group exercise significantly reduced rate of falls (RaR 0.71, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82; 16 trials; 3622 participants) and risk of falling (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.96; 22 trials; 5333 participants), as did multiple-component home-based exercise (RaR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.80; 7 trials; 951 participants and RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.94; 6 trials; 714 participants). For Tai Chi, the reduction in rate of falls bordered on statistical significance (RaR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.00; 5 trials; 1563 participants) but Tai Chi did significantly reduce risk of falling (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87; 6 trials; 1625 participants). Overall, exercise interventions significantly reduced the risk of sustaining a fall-related fracture (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.63; 6 trials; 810 participants). Multifactorial interventions, which include individual risk assessment, reduced rate of falls (RaR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.86; 19 trials; 9503 participants), but not risk of falling (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.02; 34 trials; 13,617 participants). Overall, vitamin D did not reduce rate of falls (RaR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.11; 7 trials; 9324 participants) or risk of falling (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03; 13 trials; 26,747 participants), but may do so in people with lower vitamin D levels before treatment. Home safety assessment and modification interventions were effective in reducing rate of falls (RaR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.97; 6 trials; 4208...",10.1002/14651858.cd007146.pub3,2012-09-12
"Pharmacotherapy for hyperuricemia in hypertensive patients","High blood pressure represents a major public health problem. Worldwide, approximately one fourth of the adult population has hypertension. Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest a linkage between hyperuricemia and hypertension. Hyperuricemia affects 25-40 % of patients with untreated hypertension. A much lower prevalence has been reported in normotensives or in the general population. However, whether lowering serum uric acid (SUA) might lower blood pressure (BP) is an unanswered question.",10.1002/14651858.CD008652.pub2,2013-01-31
"Adaptive increase in sample size when interim results are promising: A practical guide with examples","This paper discusses the benefits and limitations of adaptive sample size re‐estimation for phase 3 confirmatory clinical trials. Comparisons are made with more traditional fixed sample and group sequential designs. It is seen that the real benefit of the adaptive approach arises through the ability to invest sample size resources into the trial in stages. The trial starts with a small up‐front sample size commitment. Additional sample size resources are committed to the trial only if promising results are obtained at an interim analysis. This strategy is shown through examples of actual trials, one in neurology and one in cardiology, to be more advantageous than the fixed sample or group sequential approaches in certain settings. A major factor that has generated controversy and inhibited more widespread use of these methods has been their reliance on non‐standard tests and p‐values for preserving the type‐1 error. If, however, the sample size is only increased when interim results are promising, one can dispense with these non‐standard methods of inference. Therefore, in the spirit of making adaptive increases in trial size more widely appealing and readily implementable we here define those promising circumstances in which a conventional final inference can be performed while preserving the overall type‐1 error. Methodological, regulatory and operational issues are examined. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",10.1002/sim.4102,2010-11-30
"Assessment of prediction accuracy of protein function from protein-protein interaction data","Functional prediction of open reading frames coded in the genome is one of the most important tasks in yeast genomics. Among a number of large-scale experiments for assigning certain functional classes to proteins, experiments determining protein–protein interaction are especially important because interacting proteins usually have the same function. Thus, it seems possible to predict the function of a protein when the function of its interacting partner is known. However, in vitro experiments often suffer from artifacts and a protein can often have multiple binding partners with different functions. We developed an objective prediction method that can systematically include the information of indirect interaction. Our method can predict the subcellular localization, the cellular role and the biochemical function of yeast proteins with accuracies of 72.7%, 63.6% and 52.7%, respectively. The prediction accuracy rises for proteins with more than three binding partners and thus we present the open prediction results for 16 such proteins.

"Nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation","The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is temporarily to replace much of the nicotine from cigarettes to reduce motivation to smoke and nicotine withdrawal symptoms, thus easing the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence. The aims of this review were: To determine the effect of NRT compared to placebo in aiding smoking cessation, and to consider whether there is a difference in effect for the different forms of NRT (chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalers and tablets/lozenges) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes. To determine whether the effect is influenced by the dosage, form and timing of use of NRT; the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; or the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated. To determine whether combinations of NRT are more likely to lead to successful quitting than one type alone. To determine whether NRT is more or less likely to lead to successful quitting compared to other pharmacotherapies. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers with 'nicotine' or 'NRT' in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search July 2007. Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow up of less than six months. We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose, duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model. We identified 132 trials; 111 with over 40,000 participants contributed to the primary comparison between any type of NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The RR of abstinence for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.58 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50 to 1.66). The pooled RR for each type were 1.43 (95% CI: 1.33 to 1.53, 53 trials) for nicotine gum; 1.66 (95% CI: 1.53 to 1.81, 41 trials) for nicotine patch; 1.90 (95% CI: 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials) for nicotine inhaler; 2.00 (95% CI: 1.63 to 2.45, 6 trials) for oral tablets/lozenges; and 2.02 (95% CI: 1.49 to 3.73, 4 trials) for nicotine nasal spray. The effects were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. The effect was similar in a small group of studies that aimed to assess use of NRT obtained without a prescription. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum, but weaker evidence of a benefit from higher...",10.1002/14651858.CD000146.pub3,2008-01-23
"Gonadotrophin therapy for ovulation induction in subfertility associated with polycystic ovary syndrome","Approximately 15% of patients with PCOS remain anovulatory despite treatment with oral anti-oestrogen medications such as clomiphene citrate. In addition, about half of women with PCOS ovulating on anti-oestrogen treatment fail to conceive. Gonadotrophin stimulation is the next step in treatment for women who are "clomiphene resistant", however, results of gonadotrophin stimulation in women with PCOS are less successful. In PCOS associated with hypersecretion of LH, purified urinary follicle-stimulating hormone (u-FSH) preparations have theoretical advantages over the use of human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) preparations (containing both FSH and LH), but whether this claimed advantage extends into clinical practice remains uncertain. In addition, the use of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRH-a) to produce pituitary desensitisation prior to ovulation induction in PCOS has been claimed to increase the success rates of treatment as well as reduce complications such as OHSS and multiple pregnancy. Gonadotrophin preparations have also been administered via different routes (intramuscular or subcutaneous), or using different stimulation regimens and protocols (step-up or standard) in an attempt to improve efficacy.",10.1002/14651858.cd000410,2000-07-24
"Chest physiotherapy compared to no chest physiotherapy for cystic fibrosis","Chest physiotherapy is widely used in people with cystic fibrosis in order to clear mucus from the airways. To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of chest physiotherapy compared to no treatment or spontaneous cough alone to improve mucus clearance in cystic fibrosis. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 09 February 2009. Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials in which a form of chest physiotherapy (airway clearance technique) were taken for consideration in people with cystic fibrosis compared with either no physiotherapy treatment or spontaneous cough alone. Both authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and assessed trial quality. One hundred and twenty-six trials were identified by the search, of which six cross-over trials with 66 participants were found eligible for inclusion in the review. Five studies were single treatment studies; in one study each treatment regimen was used twice daily for two consecutive days. Three studies, involving 36 participants, found a higher amount of expectorated secretions during chest physiotherapy as compared to a control period. Two studies, involving 24 participants found no significant effect on pulmonary function variables following intervention. In four studies radioactive tracer clearance was used as an outcome variable. In three of these, involving 28 participants, it was found that chest physiotherapy, including coughing, increased radioactive tracer clearance as compared to the control period. One study of eight participants, reported no significant difference between chest physiotherapy, without coughing, compared to the control period. The results of this review show that airway clearance techniques have short-term effects in the terms of increasing mucus transport. No evidence was found on which to draw conclusions concerning the long-term effects.",10.1002/14651858.cd001401,2000-04-24
"Conventional chest physiotherapy compared to other airway clearance techniques for cystic fibrosis","Cystic fibrosis is an inherited life-limiting disorder, characterised by pulmonary infections and thick airway secretions. Chest physiotherapy has been integral to clinical management in facilitating removal of airway secretions. Conventional chest physiotherapy techniques (CCPT) have depended upon assistance during treatments, while more contemporary airway clearance techniques are self-administered, facilitating independence and flexibility. To compare CCPT with other airway clearance techniques in terms of their effects on respiratory function, individual preference, adherence, quality of life and other outcomes. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and conference proceedings. We also searched CINAHL from 1982 to 2002 and AMED from 1985 to 2002. Date of most recent search: 01 September 2008. Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials including those with a cross-over design where CCPT was compared with other airway clearance techniques. Studies of less than seven days duration were excluded. Two authors allocated quality scores to relevant studies and independently extracted data. If we were unable to extract data, we invited authors to submit their data. We excluded studies from meta-analysis when data were lost or study design precluded comparison. For some continuous outcomes, we used the generic inverse variance method for meta-analysis of data from cross-over trials and data from parallel-designed trials were incorporated for comparison. We also examined efficacy of specific techniques and effects of treatment duration. We identified 83 publications and 29 were included, representing 15 data sets (475 participants). There was insufficient evidence to confirm or exclude any differences, between CCPT and other airway clearance techniques in terms of respiratory function measured by standard lung function tests. Studies undertaken during acute exacerbations demonstrated relatively large gains in respiratory function irrespective of airway clearance technique. Longer-term studies demonstrated smaller improvements or deterioration over time. Ten studies reported individual preferences for technique, with participants tending to favour self-administered techniques. Heterogeneity in the measurement of preference precluded these data from meta-analysis. This review was unable to demonstrate any advantage of CCPT over other airway clearance techniques in terms of respiratory function, but this may have reflected insufficient evidence rather than real equivalence between methods. There was a trend for participants to prefer self-administered airway clearance techniques. Limitations of this review included a paucity of well-designed, adequately-powered, long-term trials.

"Insulin-sensitising drugs (metformin, troglitazone, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, D-chiro-inositol) for polycystic ovary syndrome","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterised by anovulation, hyperandrogaenemia and insulin resistance. Hyperinsulinaemia is known to be associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk and the development of diabetes mellitus. If insulin sensitising agents such as metformin are effective in treating features of PCOS, then they could have wider health benefits than just treating the symptoms of the syndrome. To assess the effectiveness of insulin sensitising drugs in improving clinical and biochemical features of PCOS. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders & Subfertility Group trials register (December 2002), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2002), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2002), and EMBASE (January 1985 to December 2002). Randomised controlled trials which investigated the effect of insulin sensitising drugs compared with either placebo or no treatment, or compared with an ovulation induction agent. Performed by two reviewers, one blinded to information that could have identified the authors, publisher or results of each study. Fifteen trials were included for analysis, 13 of them using metformin and involving 543 participants. Meta-analysis showed that metformin is effective in achieving ovulation in women with PCOS with odds ratios of 3.88 (CI 2.25 to 6.69) for metformin versus placebo and 4.41 (CI 2.37 to 8.22) for metformin and clomiphene versus clomiphene alone. An analysis of pregnancy rates suggests a significant treatment effect for metformin and clomiphene (OR 4.40, CI 1.96 to 9.85). Metformin has a significant effect in reducing fasting insulin levels (WMD -5.37, CI -8.11 to -2.63), blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL). There was no evidence of effect on body mass index or waist:hip ratio. Metformin was associated with a significantly higher incidence of nausea, vomiting and other gastrointestinal disturbance, but no serious adverse effects were reported. Metformin is an effective treatment for anovulation in women with PCOS. Its choice as a first line agent seems justified, and there is some evidence of benefit on parameters of the metabolic syndrome. Ovulation rates are higher when combined with clomiphene (76% versus 46% when used alone), but there is no evidence to indicate whether there is an increased multiple pregnancy rate with this combination. There is no data regarding its safety in long-term use in young women. It should be used as an adjuvant to general lifestyle improvements, and not as a replacement for increased exercise and improved diet.",10.1002/14651858.CD003053,2003-04-22
"Positive expiratory pressure physiotherapy for airway clearance in people with cystic fibrosis","Chest physiotherapy is widely prescribed to assist the clearance of airway secretions in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices provide constant back pressure to the airways during expiration. This may improve clearance by building up gas behind mucus via collateral ventilation. Given the widespread use of PEP devices, there is a need to determine the evidence for their effect. To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of PEP devices compared to other forms of physiotherapy as a means of improving mucus clearance and other outcomes in people with CF. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. The electronic database CINAHL was also searched from 1982 to 2001. Most recent search of the Group's register: February 2006. Randomised controlled studies in which PEP was compared with any other form of physiotherapy in people with CF. Two authors independently applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to publications and assessed the quality of the included studies. Forty studies were identified and twenty-five studies involving 507 participants met the review inclusion criteria. Most included studies had low scores on a scale of study quality. Twenty of these studies involving 300 participants were cross-over in design. Data were not published in sufficient detail in most of these studies to perform meta-analysis. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was the most frequently measured outcome. Single interventions or series of treatments continued for up to three months demonstrated no significant difference in effect between PEP and other methods of airway clearance on FEV1. Long-term studies had equivocal or conflicting results regarding the effect on FEV1. Participant preference was reported in nine studies. In all studies with an intervention period of at least one month, measures of participant preference were in favour of PEP. The results for the remaining outcome measures were not examined or reported in sufficient detail to provide any high level evidence. There was no clear evidence that PEP was a more or less effective intervention overall than other forms of physiotherapy. There was limited evidence that PEP was preferred by participants compared to other techniques, but this finding is from studies of low quality. 囊狀纖維化患者呼吸道廓清的吐氣正壓物理治療 胸部物理治療被廣泛的用於輔助囊狀纖維化(CF)患者清除呼吸道分泌物。吐氣正壓(PEP)設備可以提供呼吸道在吐氣時固定的背景壓力，它能經由側肢循環在黏液後累積空氣，以改善呼吸道廓清情形。有鑑於PEP設備的廣泛使用，我們必須確定它的效果。...",10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub3,2006-04-19
"Condom effectiveness in reducing heterosexual HIV transmission","The amount of protection that condoms provide for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections is unknown. Cohort studies of sexually active HIV serodiscordant couples with follow-up of the seronegative partner, provide a situation in which a seronegative partner has known exposure to the disease and disease incidence can be estimated. When some individuals use condoms and some do not, namely some individuals use condoms 100% of the time and some never use (0%) condoms, condom effectiveness can be estimated by comparing the two incidence rates. Condom effectiveness is the proportionate reduction in disease due to the use of condoms.",10.1002/14651858.cd003255,2002-01-21
